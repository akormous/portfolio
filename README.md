## Portfolio website

I initially created this project to learn NextJS, but now I am thinking to add a lot more functionality in this. Basically, this website should describe what I have acheived in my career and my personal hobbies and stuff like that. I am going to integrate a bunch of APIs in this to show my interests and stuff, for example:
1. Spotify API: display my recent liked songs and top artists (if possible)
2. Twitter API: display my recent tweets

and something more like that
